# Basic Calculator

This is basically a Simple Calculator for Addition, Subtraction, Multiply, Divide in [main.c](https://github.com/akhil4898/calculator/blob/master/main.c "main file")


Then, The next program is Sum of first (N) natural number. And (N) is enter by the user in [finaltest.c](https://github.com/akhil4898/calculator/blob/master/finaltest.c "finaltest file")

Then, The next program is basically on the command line argument to find the length of the strings that is entered by the user on command line in [cmdline.c](https://github.com/akhil4898/calculator/blob/master/cmdline.c "cmdline file")
